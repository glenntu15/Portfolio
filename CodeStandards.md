## Naming conventions
### C++
These are taken from Microsoft guidelines
| Name Type | Format | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Namespace | under_scored |  |
| Class Name | CamelCase | do not use C or T prefix |
| Function name	| camelCase	| Lower case start |
| Parameters/Locals |	under_scored | 	Vast majority of standards recommends this because _ is more readable to C++ crowd |
| Member variable | under_scored_with |The prefix _ is heavily discourage |
| Enums and its members |	CamelCase	Most except very old standards agree with this one |
| Globals | g_under_scored |You shouldn't have these in first place! |
| Constants | UPPER_CASE | |
| File names | Match case of class name |
